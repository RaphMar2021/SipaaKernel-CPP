# Contributing
Contributing is a wonderful thing that allows everyone in the world with a computer, and the required tools to improve SipaaKernel. Fortunately, there's some rules to get you started.

## Fork the repo to your GitHub account, and don't request permissions to write directly on the main repo.
There's something on GitHub (and others) called Pull Requests. Like the name is saying, you can request to pull some code into the repository. To do that, fork the repo and clone your fork, do your code changes and push it to your fork and then, go on the main repo and create a pull request to merge your changes in the repo.

## Respect the coding guidelines
SipaaKernel have a special set of coding guidelines that makes reading the codebase more enjoyables. These guidelines are located in CODING_GUIDELINES.md, in the root of the repo (where there's the file that you are reading right now)
